# Sorta.Fit -- Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sorta. This document covers the workflow, conventions, and guidelines for making changes.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorta.fit.git
   cd Sorta.Fit
   ```
3. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name main
   ```
4. Make your changes, test them, and commit.
5. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.

## Code Style

All bash scripts must follow these conventions:

- **Shebang:** `#!/usr/bin/env bash` on the first line.
- **Strict mode:** `set -euo pipefail` immediately after the shebang and comment header.
- **Logging:** Use the functions from `core/utils.sh` (`log_info`, `log_warn`, `log_error`, `log_step`). Do not use bare `echo` for status output.
- **Line endings:** Unix (LF) only. Configure your editor to save with LF. On Windows, set `git config core.autocrlf input`.
- **Indentation:** Two spaces. No tabs.
- **Variables:** Use uppercase for exported/environment variables (`BOARD_ADAPTER`). Use lowercase for local variables (`issue_key`). Quote all variable expansions (`"$var"`, not `$var`).
- **No hardcoded values:** Board URLs, status names, and IDs must come from environment variables or adapter config. Never hardcode project-specific values.
- **No external dependencies:** Bash scripts must only rely on tools listed in the prerequisites (bash, git, node, curl, gh, claude). Do not introduce Python, jq, or other tools.
- **Comments:** Include a file-level comment after the shebang explaining the script's purpose. Inline comments are welcome for non-obvious logic but should not restate what the code already says.

## Adding a Recipe

1. Create `recipes/{name}.sh`.

2. Use the standard boilerplate:
   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   # Recipe: {Description}
   set -euo pipefail

   SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
   SORTA_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.." && pwd)"

   source "$SORTA_ROOT/core/config.sh"
   source "$SORTA_ROOT/core/utils.sh"
   source "$SORTA_ROOT/adapters/${BOARD_ADAPTER}.sh"
   ```

3. Follow the pattern used by existing recipes:
   - Query cards from a lane using `board_get_cards_in_status`
   - For each card, fetch its details with `board_get_card_*` functions
   - Render a prompt using `render_template`
   - Run Claude with `claude -p`
   - Update the board with `board_update_description`, `board_add_comment`, and/or `board_transition`

4. Create a corresponding prompt template at `prompts/{name}.md` using `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for variable substitution.

5. Add your recipe name to the `RECIPES_ENABLED` list in `.env` to include it in the polling loop, or document it as a standalone/manual recipe.

6. Document the recipe in `docs/recipes.md` following the format used for existing recipes.

## Adding an Adapter

1. Create `adapters/{name}.sh` implementing all `board_*` functions documented in `docs/adapters.md`.

2. Create `adapters/{name}.config.sh.example` with placeholder status and transition IDs.

3. Test the adapter:
   - Run `board_discover` and verify output
   - Test each `board_*` function individually against a test project
   - Run `bash recipes/refine.sh` end-to-end to verify the full pipeline

4. Document the adapter in `docs/adapters.md`.

## Adding a Prompt Template

1. Create `prompts/{name}.md`.

2. Use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for variables that will be substituted at runtime by `render_template`.

3. Be explicit about the expected output format. Include a format specification with exact headings and structure so Claude's output can be consumed reliably by the calling recipe.

4. End the prompt with a reminder like "Output ONLY the {thing}. No preamble." to keep Claude's response clean.

## Testing

Sorta does not have a formal test suite. Testing is done by running individual recipes against a test project on your issue board.

### Setting Up a Test Environment

1. Create a test project on your issue board (e.g., a Jira project named `TEST`).
2. Configure `.env` to point at the test project.
3. Create a few cards in the To Do lane with titles and brief descriptions.
4. Run recipes individually and verify the results on the board.

### What to Verify

- Cards are read from the correct lane.
- Claude receives a well-formed prompt (check the rendered template by adding a debug print before the Claude call).
- The board is updated correctly (description, comments, transitions).
- Error cases are handled gracefully (empty responses, API failures, missing cards).
- The recipe does not modify cards it should not touch.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change. One recipe, one adapter, or one bug fix per PR.
- Include a clear description of what the PR does and how to test it.
- Ensure all scripts have the correct shebang and strict mode.
- Verify Unix line endings on all files.
- Do not include `.env` files, API tokens, or other secrets.

## Conventions Summary

| Convention | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Shell | `#!/usr/bin/env bash` + `set -euo pipefail` |
| Logging | Use `core/utils.sh` functions |
| Line endings | LF only |
| Indentation | 2 spaces |
| Variables | Uppercase for env/exported, lowercase for local |
| Dependencies | bash, git, node, curl, gh, claude only |
| Secrets | Never committed, always via `.env` |
| Templates | `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax in `prompts/*.md` |
